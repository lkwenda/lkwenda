Welcome to my GitHub page! Iâ€™m Luyando Kwenda, an engineer who loves learning, building, and figuring out how things work. Iâ€™ve watched every episode of Ultimate Airport Dubai and Air Crash Investigation, so you could say I have a fascination with how systems operateâ€”whether they run smoothly or fail spectacularly. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges, whether itâ€™s improving processes, solving problems, or just diving deep into something that sparks my curiosity. Follow along as I explore, experiment, and share what I learn along the way!
